# Anime Streaming Content Strategy  
### A Data-Driven Audience Analysis for Licensing & Platform Growth

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project analyzes long-term audience behavior in the anime industry to identify the factors that drive successful streaming content.

Using a dataset of **10,000 anime titles**, the analysis evaluates how release timing, episode structure, and viewer ratings influence audience scale — translating raw data into actionable licensing strategy insights.

The goal is to simulate the type of analysis a streaming platform might conduct when deciding:

- Which titles to acquire  
- What format performs best  
- Whether high ratings reliably translate into audience reach  
- Where hidden growth opportunities exist  

---

## ❓ Strategic Questions Answered

- Is anime demand structurally growing or driven by short-term hype?
- What series length attracts the largest audiences?
- Do elite-rated titles consistently outperform?
- How has the streaming era reshaped viewer behavior?
- Where can platforms identify undervalued content early?

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** — data cleaning and transformation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** — exploratory and strategic visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** — analytical workflow

### ⭐ Quality vs Reach
Elite-rated titles attract substantially larger audiences on average, confirming that viewer satisfaction strongly supports discoverability and word-of-mouth growth.
However, select mid-rated titles still achieve scale — highlighting the influence of franchise power and marketing.
